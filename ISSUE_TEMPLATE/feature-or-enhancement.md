<!-- Provide a general summary of your suggestion in the "Title" above -->
<!--
Optional: Provide the exact version you're experiencing issues with. This could
matter, even if it's a really old version. Do note that bugs in older versions
are commonly fixed in newer versions and that newer versions are much more
actively maintained than older versions, so it's unlikely we'll add new features
to older versions.
-->
**Version:**

<!--
Optional: Provide the name and version of both the platform (Chrome, Node, etc.)
and operating system you're running this library on. If it's multiple, feel free
to list multiple. This could matter, even if it's super ancient like IE 6 on
Windows XP.
-->
**Platform and OS:**

<!--
Optional: Provide a link to your project, if it happens to be open source or if
you created a repo somewhere that we can look into further. If it's multiple
projects, feel free to list them all.
-->
**Project:**

<!-- Required -->
**Is this something you're interested in implementing yourself?**

### Description
<!--
What exactly are you suggesting? Is it a particular missing feature? An odd
design choice you think could be improved? This doesn't need to be a concrete,
fully-fledged proposal, but it does need to be clear - it's hard to act on
suggestions that are too vague or generic.
-->

### Why
<!--
Why is this important to you? How would you use it? We need to know what
problems it would solve in the real world and what benefits it would bring, for
both you and other potential users, so we know how we should prioritize it and
so we can see if a better solution might exist.
-->

### Possible Implementation
<!--
Optional: How might this be implemented? This is optional, but it helps us put
the size and cost of the feature into perspective. Simpler features to implement
can often be justified by just being helpful, but big, complex features could
require a massive benefit to pay for their size, scale, and complexity.
-->

### Open Questions
<!--
Optional: What things still need discussed? If there are certain details you
aren't sure about, this could help inform discussion. Open questions like these
are precisely what shaped Mithril's sync vs async redraw API to be what they are
in v2.
