# Mithril's .github

This repo contains all the [default community health files](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization#supported-file-types). If you're here, you're probably lost and looking for [the main repo](https://github.com/MithrilJS/mithril.js) or maybe [one of the other various main projects](https://github.com/MithrilJS/). This is mainly for administrative purposes, so if you're not a maintainer or core developer of a package under the MithrilJS org, this is going to be about as interesting as watching water sit still, with no air or sound disturbing it at all.
